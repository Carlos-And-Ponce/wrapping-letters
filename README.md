## How to use

Wrapping letters is so easy to use!:

```
import React from "react";
import WrappingLetters from "wrapping-letters-react";


function App() {
  return <WrappingLetters  />;
}

export default App;

```

Wrapping Letters is a component for react with the goal of to simplify the job to wrap letters,
call the component and that's ready to use.  its has a default word is: "Hello world!!! <3".

If you want modifies the word, call the prop "word", this prop only acceptÂ strings

```
<WrappingLetters word="I'm the new word" />
```

Wrapping Letters has its first version !!!. In future near future versions it will have new implementations and not only will separate the letters by ``` <span> ```
You can also do from giving special classes to each letter to choosing a word to give a class or special ID <3

I need to do a better README Xd, it will also come in future updates
